# Arduino ISD2360
This project contains an Arduino software library to interact with Nuvoton ChipCorderÂ® ISD2360 devices via SPI.
It further includes an uploader consisting of a Python script and an Arduino sketch which may be used to upload
ISD2360 firmware images to the device.

## Setup
### Using the library
The library makes use of the ISD2360's `RDY/BSYB` pin for flow control. Applications must use this pin in addition
to the required SPI pins. The pin number of the `RDY/BSYB` pin must be passed to the constructor as well as the
pin number of the chip-select pin.

## Using the uploader
The uploader has so far only been tested on Linux using Python 3.8. The following non-standard dependencies are required:
  - [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
  - [`pyserial`](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)
When using pip, you may use the provided `requirements.txt` file to automatically install the dependencies as follows:
```
pip install -r ./uploader/requirements.txt
```

## Warning
Uploading an image with a VM that ends in PD on the PU macro will make life really hard. The powerUp() method 
waits for the device to become idle (PD=0, DBUF=1 & all channels idle) before proceeding so if the PU VM ends in PD,
this never happens so re-programming the ISD may be impossible.
